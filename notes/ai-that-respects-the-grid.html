                <p>I don’t want models that behave as if power is infinite and anonymous. The grid is a living
                    constraint with prices, carbon intensity, and neighbors. If the loop can only keep its
                    promises when electricity is cheap and steady, the loop is fragile. Respecting the grid means
                    writing intelligence that explicitly negotiates with time-varying costs and limits, the way a good
                    controller negotiates with friction and delay.</p>

                <p>The mechanics aren’t mystical. Give the system a budget and a view of the world beyond its GPU. Treat
                    price and carbon signals as inputs, not trivia. Then make the planner account for them the way it
                    accounts for dynamics: constrained optimization or a policy that understands trade-offs. I like the
                    language of “right-time” over “real-time.” Right-time says: meet the task’s envelope while staying
                    within the budget. Sometimes that means throttling; sometimes it means batching; sometimes it means
                    waiting for a cleaner window and finishing with the same quality for fewer Joules. The point is to
                    encode manners.</p>

                <p>There’s a clean separation of concerns that helps me think. Accuracy is about truth relative to data.
                    Service is about meeting a cadence and an SLA. Stewardship is about the grid. When you adjust one,
                    the others move. That triangle is the work. I want the policy to make those movements visible:
                    report quality, latency, and energy as a triplet, and optimize a scalar we can defend, for example,
                    quality per kilowatt-hour under an SLA. If the score gets better while the grid is spiking, we
                    actually improved, and if it only improves at 2 a.m., it’s a free lunch someone else pays for.</p>

                <p>Scheduling is where respect gets real. A budget-aware scheduler can minimize regret against an oracle
                    that knows tomorrow’s prices: run heavy jobs when intensity dips, hold when it climbs, degrade
                    gracefully when an SLA bites. For online systems, this looks like a small MPC: horizon over price
                    and load, action space that includes throttles and precision settings, constraints that guard safety
                    and responsiveness. For batch, it’s simpler: a knapsack with nonstationary weights. Either way, the
                    control question is the same: what action preserves value per Joule now?</p>

                <p>Measurement keeps the posture honest. You need synchronized counters, windowed traces, and a rule for
                    when the loop is allowed to pause. You also need to make the absence of action legible. An
                    abstention because power is scarce is not failure if the SLA and policy agree. The log should say
                    so. The worst outcome is to burn watts to uphold a ritual definition of “real-time” that the task
                    doesn’t actually require.</p>

                <p>The cultural part is small but decisive: permission to ship systems that talk about power the way
                    they talk about accuracy. That means dashboards where a rising success curve without an energy trace
                    looks unfinished; reviews where price- and carbon-aware choices are ordinary engineering, not moral
                    theater. I’m not trying to make the grid a character in the story. I’m trying to find a way to keep
                    us honest about the stage we’re standing on.</p>

                <p>I simply want loops that look up. If tomorrow’s run holds quality while regret and grams of CO₂ per
                    decision fall, we learned something that survives daylight. If not, the model worked; the system
                    didn’t.</p>
