                <p>I used to treat energy like the room temperature: note it, complain about it, then ignore it.
                    Accuracy and latency were the “real” numbers; watt-hours were logistics. The turn for me was
                    realizing that energy isn’t just background, but the cost function we pretend not to optimize. If a
                    system only shines when electricity is cheap and invisible, it isn’t robust; it’s subsidized by
                    silence.</p>

                <p>When I say “energy as a metric,” I don’t mean an after-the-fact footnote. I mean a number that stands
                    next to accuracy and latency in the first line of a result. The simplest one I trust is a ratio:
                    quality per kilowatt-hour. Pick the quality that actually governs the task (mAP, success rate,
                    control stability) and divide by measured kWh for a fixed protocol. That single fraction forces
                    honest trade-offs. Raise batch size, lower precision, change the planner: if the ratio goes up, we
                    improved the system; if it goes down, we bought a headline.</p>

                <p>The protocol matters more than the instrument. I like short, repeatable windows because repeatability
                    beats grand measurement, for instance: sixty seconds of work with synchronized counters and a stable
                    workload. Report Joules, not guesses: on-board power sensors where possible; otherwise an external
                    meter and careful alignment with the log. Then keep the units legible to non-experts. Joules become
                    Wh; Wh become grams of CO₂e using a grid-specific factor. It isn’t perfect, but it’s more honest
                    than pretending “energy” is a property of the model rather than the world it runs in.</p>

                <p>Energy also changes what we mean by “real-time.” The right question isn’t “Can it run at X Hz?” It’s
                    “What cadence meets the task while staying inside the budget?” Some loops can tolerate bounded
                    jitter if the planner knows its envelope. Some workloads should wait ten minutes for cleaner power
                    and then finish with the same quality at a lower cost per answer. Treating time, accuracy, and
                    energy as a Pareto surface; as a habit, not a paper figure; makes design less theatrical and more
                    civil.</p>

                <p>There are familiar companions to the ratio. Energy-Delay Product tells you when you traded too much
                    latency for thrift. Rank stability checks whether your energy conclusions survive small protocol
                    nudges. Selective reporting is a smell; abstain from comparisons you can’t instrument properly. And
                    remember that energy is not a moral category, but a way to keep systems accountable to the
                    infrastructure they depend on like hospitals, homes, and other people’s work.</p>

                <p>What I want, ultimately, is cultural: plots where a rising accuracy curve without a corresponding
                    energy trace looks unfinished; reviews where “quality per kWh” is a first question, not an appendix;
                    code that makes the measurement boring. The realization I needed to say out loud, mostly to myself,
                    is simple: energy is not a constraint you bolt on after you’ve “won.” It is a lens that changes what
                    winning means. I’ll know this has stuck when my dashboards feel incomplete without that ratio, and
                    when decisions start moving because the line did.</p>
