                <p class="meta">2025-08-07</p>
            </header>
            <section class="card notes-body">
                <p>I want scientific computing to feel like turning on a tap. Reliable, not glamorous. You expect clean
                    water at pressure, within a known range of temperature and impurities, with a meter you can read and
                    a bill you can dispute. Our pipelines should work the same way: available, audited, boring to
                    operate, and clear about what they can’t do. Right now too much of the work depends on personalities
                    and folklore. If progress relies on whoever remembers which flag made the figure, that’s not a
                    good system.</p>

                <p>The utility mindset starts with provenance. Every step becomes a node in a DAG with content-addressed
                    inputs and outputs: model@sha, data@sha, code@sha, env@sha. If any hash changes, the graph knows
                    what to rebuild. That single fact gives you repeatability and trust. You can ask “what produced this
                    number?” and get a path, not a story. Byte-identical reproduction is how collaborators disagree
                    safely. If I can’t regenerate your result by pinning the same addresses, the argument will drift
                    into taste.</p>

                <p>Uptime and latency belong here too. Pipelines should publish an SLO the way services do: p95
                    time-to-reproduce, p95 time-to-ingest, error budgets that burn visibly. When a workflow exceeds its
                    SLO, it should degrade in a defined way (smaller sample, lower fidelity, cached artifact with a
                    warning) rather than timing out and wasting the day. It’s about aligning expectations so decisions
                    don’t stall on invisible friction. When compute behaves like a utility, planning becomes possible.
                </p>

                <p>Interfaces matter more than implementations. A pipeline that accepts typed, unit-annotated inputs and
                    emits typed, unit-annotated outputs with a schema version is a public promise. Pre-conditions fail
                    fast; post-conditions are checked in the same run. Logs are first-class artifacts, not console
                    graffiti: timestamps, seeds, device info, and a minimal audit trail for which human touched what.
                    None of this is heavy. Most of it fits in a dozen lines of YAML and a small wrapper. The point is to
                    reduce the surface area where personality can hide.</p>

                <p>Fairness is a utility question too: who gets water when demand spikes. Shared infrastructure that
                    exposes price signals (dollars, queue time, grams CO₂ per run) allows teams to schedule work like
                    adults. Concessions become policy, not favors: batch jobs shift to off-peak; heavy runs require a
                    justification tied to impact; long-lived artifacts are archived with a retention plan. It’s easier
                    to be generous when the meter is honest. It’s also easier to say no without drama.</p>

                <p>I’ve learned to like boredom in this context. Boring means the same command works tomorrow. Boring
                    means a new collaborator can rerun a figure on their machine without summoning a wizard. Boring
                    frees the interesting parts; the ideas, the models, the measurements; from glue code and guesswork.
                    The romance is in the question we can finally ask because the build no longer gets in the way, not
                    in the build itself.</p>

                <p>What I would like is two curves that climb together: time-to-reproduce trending down, and
                    provenance coverage trending up. When those move in tandem across projects and institutions, we’ll
                    have something close to a utility: scientific compute that you can trust with public work because it
                    behaves like public infrastructure. Not a tap that gushes novelty, just one that runs clear.</p>
