                <p>I design my research the way I design my controllers: with a budget in view. Time, compute, and
                    carbon are the knobs that shape what I’m allowed to learn, not afterthoughts to clean up in a
                    footnote. When I forget that, the work gets theatrical with bigger sweeps, fancier charts, and
                    little to show for it. When I remember, the problem gets sharper. A budget is a coordinate system,
                    not a scold.</p>

                <p>The first decision is to name the currencies. Wall-clock hours, joules or kilowatt-hours, dollars if
                    they clarify, and opportunity cost. Then I make the trade-off explicit: we optimize a scalar we can
                    defend, often “quality per unit budget” under an SLA. That pushes me toward designs that degrade
                    gracefully. Anytime algorithms that improve with time instead of demanding a lump sum.
                    Multi-fidelity search where cheap signals prune dead branches before I pay for the high-fidelity
                    run. Early stopping rules that end a configuration as soon as its best case can’t beat the current
                    Pareto front. None of this is ascetic. It’s how you reserve energy for the parts that change your
                    mind.</p>

                <p>I’ve stopped trusting unconstrained hyperparameter search. It looks scientific and feels productive,
                    but it treats compute as ambient and the real objective as a secret. Budgeted search is plainer and
                    more honest. You set the envelope and you ask: within this, which configurations are
                    Pareto-superior? That question admits real answers. You can compare methods by quality, latency, and
                    energy and treat the frontier with respect. You can also decide to live just off the frontier if
                    that saves half the cost for a sliver of performance. Taste returns once the math is on the table.
                </p>

                <p>Measurement keeps this from turning into slogans. I keep a ledger of dollars per percentage point of
                    improvement, grams of CO₂ per correct decision, minutes per one standard deviation reduction in
                    error. Energy-Delay Product tells me when I paid too much latency for thrift. “Regret” against an
                    oracle that knows tomorrow’s prices tells me whether the scheduler is learning. If a configuration
                    looks great but its quality-per-kWh collapses under a different workload window, it’s not robust;
                    it’s lucky.</p>

                <p>The culture has to move with the math. Teams need permission to publish smaller experiments with
                    tighter inference instead of sprawling grids that impress nobody. Review should ask for budget
                    adherence and what the stop rule was, not just whether the last line is bold. I care less about the
                    maximum obtained and more about the slope: how fast did we learn per unit spent, and could we have
                    learned the same lesson with less? If the answer is “yes,” the design was indulgent.</p>

                <p>All of this reads as constraint, but it’s actually a way to keep ambition intact. Budgets prevent me
                    from burning cycles on noise and free me to try shapes that would be impractical under an unbounded
                    mindset, like, anytime control with calibrated exits, hybrid pipelines that switch fidelity on the
                    fly, and evaluation that runs nightly without a guilt meter. The work feels calmer, and the results
                    travel.</p>

                <p>I give myself a simple test: if I halve the budget, can I still make a defensible decision? If I
                    can’t, I haven’t built a method, only dependence. What I want are studies that reveal the frontier
                    quickly, then let me decide where to stand on it; eyes open to price, compute, and carbon, not
                    because I’m timid, but because I want what I build to survive outside the lab.</p>
